# A comparative analysis of optimization algorithms for the Binary Perceptron

This repository contains the code for my Bocconi University bachelor's thesis (see thesis_.pdf). It implements and compares standard Simulated Annealing and Gradient Descent against their "replicated" versions for solving the Binary Perceptron problem.

## Results

The following plots showcase the comparative performance of the two algorithms under different interaction settings.

### Gradient Descent Comparison
